Chapter One: Principles And Objectives
====================================

1. Name and Constitution
1.1. The name of the association is "The Queensland Greens Inc.", hereinafter referred to as 'the party'.

1.2. This constitution identifies the principles governing the conduct of the party's affairs and the bodies responsible for implementing them.

1.3. The Queensland Greens is a member body of the Australian Greens, the national confederation of state and Territory Green parties.

1.4 All other party documents are subordinate to this constitution. This constitution is subordinate to the constitution of the Australian Greens.
 
 
2. The Charter of The Greens
Basis For Action
 
We live at a crucial time in history. Never before have we had so many answers to the problems that have dogged our developing world.

Solutions now exist that could greatly decrease the poverty, hunger and ill health of our fellow humans and we now have technologies to reduce and repair much of the ecological damage to our planet.

Clean air, clean water and ecological sustainability are possible. Yet this is not being achieved. World-wide, governments lack the political will to make the necessary adjustments that will bring an end to the conflict, pollution, poor health and social inequity that characterise our time.

The Greens have evolved in this climate to show a new way forward. A Green response to the ecological crisis proceeds on the basis of a respect for all life, both human and non-human.

We recognise the mutual interdependence between humanity and the rest of nature and we seek to move toward an ecologically sustainable path.

We seek to eradicate poverty, oppression and discrimination and to build a society underpinned by values of participatory democracy, social justice, and the respect for cultural and ecological diversity.

We aim to transform the political, social and economic structures that disempower and oppress people and to develop a rich, participatory cultural life that enables the flourishing of new democratic movements for progressive change.

We believe that contesting elections is a necessary step toward the building of an ecologically sustainable and socially just society, but that it is by no means the only step.

We seek to encourage and facilitate grassroots movements and community initiatives that are working towards ecological responsibility, social justice, affirmative action and global equity.

We seek to avoid parochialism and to cultivate a global, ecological consciousness and a long-term perspective in order to safeguard the interests of both existing and future generations and nonhuman species.

We believe Australia should play an active role in building a more cooperative world that is capable of addressing the glaring disparities in energy and resource consumption and quality of life between rich and poor.

We aim to extend recognition and assistance to progressive social movements in other countries and to international institutions that are working toward these ends.

Reflecting an awareness of the interrelatedness of all ecological, social and economic processes the general principles of The Greens are:

2.1. Ecology
a) To ensure that human activity respects the integrity of ecosystems and does not impair biodiversity and ecological resilience of life-supporting systems.
b) To encourage the development of a consciousness that respects the value of all life.
 
2.2. Democracy
a) To increase opportunities for public participation in political, social and economic decision-making.
b) To break down inequalities of wealth and power which inhibit participatory democracy.
 
2.3. Social justice
a) To eradicate poverty by developing initiatives that address the causes as well as the symptoms of poverty.
b) To provide affirmative action to eliminate discrimination based on gender, age, race, ethnicity, class, religion, disability, sexuality, or membership of a minority group.
c) To introduce measures that redress the imbalance of wealth between rich and poor.
 
2.4. Peace
a) To adopt and promote the non-violent resolution of conflict.
b) To develop an independent, non-aligned foreign policy and a non-nuclear, defensive, self-reliant defence policy.
 
2.5. An ecologically sustainable economy
a) To develop economic policies that will ensure greater resource and energy efficiency and development and use of environmentally sustainable technologies.
b) To reduce dependence on non-renewable resources and ensure sustainable use of renewable resources.
c) To adopt more comprehensive social, environmental and technology assessment practices.
d) To facilitate socially and ecologically responsible investment.
 
2.6. Meaningful Work
a) To encourage, develop and assist work that is safe, fairly paid, socially useful, personally fulfilling and not harmful to the environment.
b) To encourage and facilitate more flexible work arrangements (such as job sharing, part-time work, self-employment), on-going education, training and social welfare (including child-care) so that more people can engage in meaningful work.
 
2.7. Culture
a) To respect and protect ethnic, religious, racial diversity.
b) To recognise the cultural requirements of the original Australians and to assist in ensuring the achievement of Aboriginal land rights and self-determination.
 
2.8. Information
a) To facilitate a free flow of information between citizens and all tiers of government.
b) To ensure that Australians have the benefit of a locally responsible, diverse, democratically controlled and independent mass media.
 
2.9. Global responsibility
To promote equity between nations and peoples by:
a) facilitating fair trading relationships.
b) providing for increased development assistance and concerted international action to abolish Third World Debt
c) providing increased green technology transfer and skills to developing countries
d) opposing human rights abuses and political oppression
e) ensuring that Australia plays an active role in promoting peace and ecological sustainability.
 
2.10. Long-term future focus
a) To avoid action which might risk long-term or irreversible damage to the environment.
b) To safeguard the planet's ecological resources and values on behalf of future generations.
 
 
3. Means
3.1. To seek the election or appointment to public office of people who are committed to the Greens' principles, policies and objectives.
 3.1.1 To promote the election to the Federal Parliament and the Queensland Legislative Assembly candidates endorsed by the party or by a body or organisation of which it forms a part.
 
3.2. By electoral strategies and direction of voting preferences, to encourage other political parties to adopt our objectives.
 
3.3. Our view of social change involves more than merely the substitution of one lot of decision makers with another lot who will act more responsibly.
We aim for changes that will empower all people and allow them to act in greater harmony with each other and the rest of nature. Therefore, while contesting elections is an important part of our strategy it is by no means the only one. We will also be involved in grassroots campaigns which are essential, if destructive and undemocratic values in the community are going to be seriously challenged by our movement. These campaigns shall include:
 
a) Resistance to oppressive and destructive practices, using non-violent direct means.
b) Promote research and education of ourselves and the community which allows us and others to analyse more vigorously, act more effectively, and envision the future with more compassion and understanding.
c) Co-operation with like minded green organisations both in Australia and overseas so that their complementary efforts for human rights and environmental protection are seen part of a multi-faceted and global project.

11.1 A quorum check takes precedence over all other business.  A call for a quorum check requires that the Secretary, or in the absence of the Secretary then the facilitator, to confirm that a quorum is present.
11.1.1 A call for quorum can not be called sooner than 15 minutes after quorum was previously established.

11.2 Quorum shall be a simple majority unless otherwise stated.

12.3.9 Godwin’s law.   A comparison of a member or a member’s position to Hitler or the Nazis has been made and whoever made the comparison has automatically lost the floor and the right to speak for the rest of the meeting.

12.4 Point of clarification. If a person’s remarks are misquoted or grossly distorted, the person may rise and ask permission to make a point of clarification. The person should correct only the statements wrongly attributed and not proceed to make a speech.  Whether to allow a point of clarification will be ruled on by the facilitator.

12.5 Point of information. This is to provide a reference to information such as relevant sections of the constitution, bylaws, minutes, budget or other documentation that is directly relevant to a point raised by a speaker. Points of information should be brief and factual, not the giving of an opinion.  Whether to allow a point of information will be ruled on by the facilitator.

13. Procedural Motions
13.1 Procedural motions take precedence over all other business except a quorum check and points of order.

13.2 The facilitator can move procedural motions.

13.3 The following procedural motions require only a mover, will be ruled on by the facilitator and cannot be debated:-
13.3.1 Reply. That the mover or seconder of a motion, or person specifically mentioned in the discussion, be able to reply to a point or points raised in precedence to the speakers list.
13.3.2 Follow-up. The speaker be allowed to speak again during a discussion or debate.
13.3.3 Observer.  That a member who does not have speaking rights at the meeting be granted leave to be speak on a particular matter.

13.4 The following procedural motions require a mover and seconder, will be ruled on by the facilitator and cannot be debated:-

13.6.6 Online procedure. That the motion be referred to be debated using the online procedure.
13.6.7 Urgency. That the required notice for a motion be waived due to urgency. Urgency means that the matter cannot be deferred to the next meeting and it would be detrimental to the Party for it not to be dealt with at the current meeting. This mechanism can only be utilised immediately subsequent to a call for quorum as per 11.1.1. If the proposal requires use of an extension of time of the meeting then Urgency cannot be used and the Waive notice procedural motion must be attempted instead.


13.7 The following procedural motion requires a mover and seconder, consensus by the meeting and can be debated:-
13.7.1 Suspend standing orders. That a specified standing order be suspended for a specified purpose.
13.7.2 Waive notice. That the required notice to a motion be waived due to urgency. This mechanism can only be utilised immediately subsequent to a call for quorum as per 11.1.1.

13.9 The following procedural motions only require a mover, will be decided by the meeting, can be debated, a temporary facilitator will be appointed for the duration of the discussion, and cannot be ruled ultra vires:-
13.9.1 Ruling.  If there is dissent with the ruling of the facilitator then there will be a motion that the ruling of the facilitator be upheld.  If the ruling does not receive the confidence of a two-thirds majority then the ruling is not upheld and is reversed.
13.9.2 Confidence.  That the facilitator retains the confidence of the meeting.  If the facilitator does not receive the confidence of a two-thirds majority then they are removed and a new facilitator appointed.

14. Consensus procedure
14.1 Seeking consensus in committee will be the default mechanism for dealing with motions and amendments.

14.2 Upon a motion or amendment being seconded, the facilitator will test for consensus.  If there is consensus then the motion is deemed to have passed.  If there is not consensus the facilitator will ask for participants to indicate if they are seeking:-
14.2.1 Clarification;
14.2.2 To make amendments;
14.2.3 To oppose the motion or amendment, and if so whether there is an intention to `Block’ consensus.

14.3 A speakers list will be generated.
14.3.1 The maximum number of speakers on the speakers list will be determined by the amount of time allocated divided by the minutes allocated per speaker plus one.
14.3.2 The speakers list will be progressive so that members who have not yet spoken will be given priority.

14.4 Dissent to a motion or amendment is most productively dealt with by either signalling whether the dissent is irreconcilable or by proposing an amendment to the motion (in writing).

14.5 If dissent is such that the motion requires significant amendment before it is able to passed by consensus, a breakout group (ideally consisting of at least the mover, seconder and any dissenters) should work on the amended motion apart from the plenary and present a motion to the plenary after they have reached a decision.

14.6 The facilitator shall occasionally test the mood of the meeting to determine if more time is required on the motion.

14.7 There is no implicit right of reply for the mover of a motion during discussion contrary to the speakers list.

14.8 The facilitator when testing for consensus will allow at least 10 seconds for dissent to be registered.

14.9 At the conclusion of discussion before the motion or amendment is put the mover has a right of reply for two minutes. In replying to the discussion the mover must not introduce any new matter but should only answer the arguments raised.

14.10 There shall not be, at one time, more than one substantive motion or amendment on the floor.

14.11 Delegates who have instructions from their branch to block consensus on the initial wording of a particular proposal should declare such conditions before an issue is discussed. Delegates should indicate if there are any conditions under which they can participate in consensus.

14.12 When a `reasonable period of time’ has passed and a decision cannot be deferred, and consensus cannot be reached then there may be a procedural motion to move to vote.  A `reasonable period of time’ is defined as:
14.12.1 when the time limit on an agenda item under discussion has passed; and
14.12.2 any resolution by consensus is unlikely to be reached quickly; or
14.12.3 when consensus on a proposal is continually blocked and there is obviously no movement towards resolution by consensus; and
14.12.4 all avenues to reach consensus have failed, e.g.
14.12.5 small group process;
14.12.6 objectors to a proposal prepared to step aside; and
14.12.7 new proposals or amendments put forward to address concerns raised defeated.

14.12 A motion will be deemed carried by a two-thirds majority of delegates present, as prescribed by the constitution.

14.13 Once a vote has been taken the meeting will revert back to the consensus process.

15. Formal meeting procedure
15.1 Formal meeting procedure would be used where debate is particularly contentious and after passing of the relevant procedural motion to adopt the procedure.

15.2 The facilitator will confirm the substantive motion, and will call for a mover and seconder for the motion.
15.2.1 If there is not a mover and seconder for a motion, then the motion lapses and will not be debated.

15.3 Once a motion is seconded two speakers lists will be generated, `For’ and `Against’.
15.3.1 If there are no Against speakers the motion will proceed directly to a vote.

15.4 The following order of debate for a motion will be:-:
15.4.1 mover (5 minutes);
15.4.2 the first speaker from the `Against’ speakers list (2 minutes);
15.4.3 the first speaker from the `For’ speakers list  (2 minutes);
15.4.4 the second speaker from the `Against’ speakers list  (2 minutes);
15.4.5 the second speaker from the `For’ speakers list  (2 minutes);
15.4.6 the third speaker from the `Against’ speakers list  (2 minutes);
15.4.7 the third speaker from the `For’ speakers list  (2 minutes);
15.4.8 Subsequent rounds of speakers `Against’ and `For’ (2 minutes each) will only be allowed if sufficient time was allocated to the motion on the agenda or by the meeting and be at the discretion of the facilitator;
15.4.9 mover's right of reply (3 minutes); and
15.4.10 a vote taken.
15.4.11 If at any time during the order of debate there are no further speakers `Against’ then the debate will proceed directly to the mover’s right of reply.

15.6 A debate on an amendment suspends debate on the motion.
15.6.1 As the amendment is a separate question, speakers who have already spoken to the proposal may speak to the amendment.
15.6.2 Once the amendment has been voted on, debate on the motion resumes where it was suspended.

15.6 The order of debate for an amendment will be:-
15.6.1 mover (3 minutes);
15.6.2 the first speaker from the `Against’ speakers list (2 minutes);
15.6.3 the first speaker from the `For’ speakers list  (2 minutes);
15.6.4 the second speaker from the `Against’ speakers list  (2 minutes);
15.6.5 the second speaker from the `For’ speakers list  (2 minutes); and
15.6.5 a vote taken.
15.6.6 If at any time during the order of debate there are no further speakers `Against’ then the motion will proceed directly to a vote.

15.7 There shall not be, at one time, more than one substantive motion or amendment on the floor.

15.8 If some aspect of formal meeting procedure is not covered by these by-laws the meeting should refer to the reference book by Renton on meeting procedure.

16. Defence of thesis procedure
16.1 The defence of thesis procedure would be used where carriage of a detailed motion or amendment is effectively undertaken by one or two people and after passing of the relevant procedural motion.

16.2 If there is dissent a list of those dissenting will be used to form the speakers list.
16.2.1 Speakers may speak more than once or may delegate their turn to a devil’s advocate.

16.3 The number of speakers on the speakers list will be limited to the time allocated divided by four.  Each speaker will be allocated two minutes.

16.4 The mover of the motion or amendment will have:-
16.4.1 At least two minutes to initially speak to the motion or amendments, or longer with permission of the meeting;
16.4.2 One minute right of reply after each speaker;
16.4.3 Two minutes for summation before the motion is put.

17. Parallel motion procedure
17.1 The parallel motion procedure would be used to determine which of several approaches that would be passed has the most support and after passing of the relevant procedural motion.
17.2 Proposed changes to motions would take the form of alternate motions rather than amendments or foreshadowed motions.
17.3 Only those proposing a parallel motion may speak.
17.4 A motion (including the original motion) may be withdrawn by the participant who moved it with the consensus of the meeting.
17.5 Passing motions will be via approval where voters can indicate support for any or all or no motions.  Any motion with the most support and meeting the threshold of two-thirds support required to change the status quo will be successful.
17.5.1 The meeting can determine to conduct an approval ballot to be conducted by the Returning Officer.
17.5.2 In the event of a tie there would be a vote to decide between the tied motions

18. Voting on motions or amendments
18.1 Voting on a motion or amendment requires a procedural motion `Move to vote’.
18.1.1 If the procedural motion is accepted by consensus then there will be a vote on the motion or amendment.
18.1.2 If the procedural motion is not accepted by consensus then there will be a vote to vote.
18.2 Voting will be by show of delegate slips.
18.2.1 Those holding proxies will be allocated delegate slips for those proxies.
18.3 Motions or amendments will be carried by a two thirds majority of those voting, meaning abstentions do not count towards the total.
18.4 The Returning Officer will count the votes and return the result to the facilitator who will report the results to the meeting.
18.4.1 The Returning Officer may appoint assistants to assist with counting the votes.
18.5 The facilitator will ensure that the votes of any delegates participating remotely are sought.

19. Voting on positions

19.1 The ballot shall contain a box for a dummy candidate of "No further nominees". A voter may express this option as any preference. Any candidates ranked after "No further nominees" shall be counted as if there was no preference expressed for this candidate.

19.2 The following method will select single positions:-
19.2.1 If, after all first preference votes have been counted, no nominee has obtained an absolute majority of all formal votes, then the candidate with the fewest number of first preference votes is excluded. That excluded nominee’s second preference votes are then distributed to the remaining candidates.
19.2.2 If after that exclusion no nominee has obtained an absolute majority of formal votes, the next remaining nominee with the fewest votes is excluded and all of their votes (ie. first preference votes plus those votes received from excluded candidates) are distributed to the remaining candidates. `No further nominee’ is not excluded.
19.2.3 If at any exclusion, the next available preference is for a previously excluded nominee, then that preference is disregarded and the vote is distributed to the continuing nominee for whom the next available preference is shown.
19.2.4 This process is continued until one nominee obtains an absolute majority of formal votes and is elected.

19.3 The following method of proportional counting will determine appointments for multiple positions:-
19.3.1 Based on an optional preferential single transferable vote using a Droop quota.
19.3.2 If `No further nominee' is to be elected any remaining positions in the ballot are declared empty.

19.4 The Returning Officer may arrange to use software to facilitate determining the results of the ballots.

19.5 The order of appointment will be recorded.

19.6 The ballots for delegates participating remotely will be collected by the Returning Officer
19.6.1 The Returning Officer may collect ballots for remotely participating delegates verbally or by reasonable electronic means.

20. Online procedure

20.1 Step One.  Submission of motions.  The timeline for seeking consensus on motions by the party body on the members' site is as follows from the time of submission of a motion.

20.2 Step Two. There will be two weeks for discussion and the opportunity to submit alternate motions. Alternative motions do not replace, or amend, an existing motion but exist in parallel.
20.2.1 A motion (including the original) may be withdrawn by the participant who submitted it with the permission of the convenor of the party body.
20.2.2 The withdrawal of all motions will result in the cessation of the process after two days if no further motions are submitted.
20.2.3 Participants who have a vote may indicate consent or otherwise for motions during this period but are not obliged to do so.

20.3 Step Three. Following step two there will be one week for participants who have a vote in to indicate consent, or otherwise, to any motions not withdrawn.
20.3.1 If after a week and a quorum of participation has been achieved there is only one motion with the consent of all participants then that motion is deemed accepted by consensus.
20.3.2 If at any time during the week there is a consensus from all participants entitled to a vote then that motion is deemed accepted by consensus immediately.
20.3.3 If after a week and a quorum of participation has been achieved no motion has the consent of all those participating the process proceeds to step four A (see 18.4.1).
20.3.4 If after a week and a quorum of participation has been achieved more than one motion has the consent of those participating the process proceeds to step four B (see 20.4.2).
20.3.5 Step concludes when all entitled to a vote on the relevant Party body have indicated their position regardless of whether the entire week has elapsed.

20.4 Step Four
20.4.1 Step Four A – No Consensus. If no motion garners consent from all participants exercising their vote then the process returns to step two. All motions not withdrawn are retained as active.
20.4.2 Step Four B – Multiple Consensus. If more than one motion gets consent from all participants exercising their vote there will be a preferential ballot to determine the preferred motion. There will be one week for all Members, Delegates, or Representatives entitled to a vote on the Party body to vote.
20.4.3 Step Four C - Consensus.  If one motion gets consent from all participants exercising their vote then that motion is deemed to have passed.

20.5 A procedural motion may be made at any time, but will be conducted in parallel to the ongoing business of the Party body.  That is the Party body may continue attempts to reach consensus, discussion and votes on a motion that would be effected by the procedural motion until such time as the procedural motion is resolved.
20.5.1 A procedural motion will be deemed carried by a two-thirds majority of votes, if the quorum threshold is reached.
20.5.2 Once a procedural motion is submitted, or triggered, those entitled to vote have one week to vote on the motion.
20.5.3 A procedural motion is decided as soon as either more than two thirds of eligible votes have indicated support for the motion or more than one third of eligible votes have indicated opposition to the motion, or the week has elapsed.  If the week has passed without the procedural motion being passed it is deemed to have lapsed.
20.5.4 Procedural motions take effect from the time they are decided.

20.6 If a procedural motion is carried to vote on the submitted active motions, a vote will be taken.
20.6.1 The vote will be a compulsory preferential vote, with the addition of `Status quo' as an option that remains in the count until the conclusion.
20.6.2 To pass a motion requires a two-thirds majority versus the status quo option once preferences are distributed.

20.7 Appointing people to positions will proceed directly to a vote once nominations close.

21. Reports
21.1 Speakers giving a report will by default be granted a maximum of ten minutes unless otherwise specified.

21.2 The speaker giving a report may be given the opportunity to respond to a direct question but this does not imply a right of reply to every speaker.

22. Teleconferencing/Online participation
22.1 The facilitator will:-
22.1.1 From time to time check with participants online that they are still present and able to follow proceedings.
22.1.2 Ensure that participants online have an opportunity to be included on the speakers’ list.

23. Miscellaneous

23.1 That a fine of $2 be levied on any member whose mobile phone or other electronic device interrupts a meeting.  The imposition of the fine will be ruled on by the facilitator.  Any money collected in this manner will go towards the costs of the meeting.

23.2 Any documents to be circulated must be submitted to the Secretary.
23.2.1 The Secretary can determine that a document not be circulated if it is not relevant to the meeting.

1. Preamble
1.1 The purpose of this bylaw is to set out a method by which consultation and determination of preferences will be carried out in Queensland.
1.2 This by-law is subject to the Queensland Constitution and the Australian Greens Constitution. This process is designed to support the following provisions: -
1.2.1 Direction of preferences for elections for single Member electorates, or for local government elections, will be made by the relevant constituent body. A dispute between constituent bodies will be resolved by State Council.
1.2.2 Direction of preferences for multi-member electorates, such as the Senate, will be decided by the State Council or the Queensland Campaign Committee.
1.2.3 The State Council or the Queensland Campaign Committee may delegate responsibility for allocation of preferences to the National Council or its authorised campaign committee.
1.3 The goal of this process is to maximise consultation on preferences while still allowing for efficient negotiations between parties.

2. Master Tickets

2.1.1 Political parties registered with the Australian Electoral Commission or the Electoral Commission Queensland that:-

2.2.1 There will be an option for `Open Ticket’, meaning no direction of preferences in a lower house electorate, included in a Master Ticket ballot. This will have no effect on preferences for the Senate.

2.4 The campaign committee will be permitted to provide an assessment of registered parties as part of the ballot.
2.5 Master Ticket ballots will be conducted electronically, annually as soon as practicable after the beginning of April, with voting open for a period of two weeks.
2.5.1 In the event that Master Ticket ballot overlaps with an official election period then the period for voting will contract to four days, or if it cannot be completed before the close of nominations then the previous Master Ticket will stay in effect. 
2.6 If the participation rate for members of a branch in a Master Ticket ballot is less than the quorum for a meeting of the relevant branch, then the average results for the state will apply as the Master Ticket for electorates covered by that branch. 
2.6.1 The preferences for any options in the ballot as per 2.1.2 or 2.1.3 specific to that branch will revert to being determined by Queensland Campaign Committee.
2.7 Every Master Ticket ballot will be accompanied by a `Yes/No option to `Allow the Queensland Campaign Committee to determine preferences to implement strategy and conduct negotiations.’

3.1 A Possible Ticket Variation (PTV) is an allowable variation from the Master Ticket passed by specific party-wide ballot conducted electronically.
3.2 PTV ballots can be initiated before, after, or in conjunction with the Master Ticket ballot, by the Queensland Campaign Committee or State Council.
3.2.1 To limit the number of ballots the Campaign Committee will attempt to hold PTV ballots in conjunction with the Master Ticket ballot.

3.6 For a PTV ballot to pass, it must have the approval of strictly above 50% of the total vote and strictly above 50% approval from the voting membership of each directly affected branch.
3.6.1 If the participation rate for a branch in a ballot is less than the quorum for a branch meeting then the PTV will be deemed to have passed. 
3.7 The campaign committee has discretion whether to implement an approved PTV.

4. Independents & Other parties
4.1 The Queensland Campaign Committee, or its delegate, in consultation with the convenor of the relevant Local Campaign Committee, will determine the allocation of preferences to any independents not covered by 2.1.
4.2 The Queensland Campaign Committee, or its delegate, will determine the preferencing for any party not covered by 2.1.

5. Publication of preference position
5.1 The results of PTV ballots will be announced at the discretion of the campaign committee or following the election.
